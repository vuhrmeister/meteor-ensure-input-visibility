# Ensures the visibility of a focused input field

When you have a form and on mobile you tab into a field the keyboard shows up. In that case normally the input field will be potentially hidden by the keyboard.
This happens also when your viewport is rotated to landscape or vise versa.

This small package brings the focused input field back into viewport.

## Installation

```
meteor add vuhrmeister:ensure-input-visibility
```

That's all. It will work automatically.
